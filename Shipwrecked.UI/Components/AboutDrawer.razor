    <p>
        The purpose of the game is to survive however you can. You're stuck on a
        tropical Island, so you can either try and escape on your own by building
        a raft & floating to safety, or by building a large signal fire on
        the beach in an attempt to attract help. Maybe your best bet is to simply
        wait patiently till someone comes to find you. I mean, after such a large
        ship went down SOMEONE's bound to come looking for survivors, Right?
